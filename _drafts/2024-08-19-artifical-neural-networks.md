If you have been following AI or tech-related news in the past few years you will have almost certainly heard of the term **Artifical Neural Networks (ANNs).** ANNs have been garnerning increasing amounts of attention in the mainstream media, due to their relevance in larger popular models, like the transformer architecture-based GPT model. 

Unfortunately in today's article we will not be (re)building [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) or any of its variants (although that might make for an interesting future topic ðŸ¤”), but rather we focus on understanding the key components in building models like it --- ANNs and their inner workings. Aritifical Neural Networks, as implied by the *Artifical* in the term, are biologically inspired AI models that focus on training the **neurons** in their network in order to map to desired models outputs for certain inputs. In many ways they actually work like the neurons we have in our brains, allowing us to adapt to new inputs, learn from them, and make internal changes ðŸ¤¯!

As you can imagine this topic, although very interesting, can be quite complicated and hard to follow. Therefore, in this article we will be using the following roadmap:
1. Introduction to Artifical Neuron and Perceptron
2. The Multilayer Perceptron
3. Case Study: Training a Product Classification Robot!

In our case study we will be working with a grocery-robot ðŸ¤–ðŸ›’ that has no knowledge of what kind of product an apple is ðŸ’­. However, it can determine the features of a product using its sensors. Based on features such as the shape, color, weight, and wrapping of a product, it can recognize specific classes. The problem can be simplified into **classification**, which can be performed by an ANN. Our job will be designing our ANN in order to best predict what product belongs to a given input âœ….

Through this process, we will discuss how to select **hyperparameters** and **loss functions** for your model. Moreover, we also cover topics like **regularization**, **learning rate**, and **batch size**, which can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your ANN.

With that being said let us get started!

### Introduction to Artifical Neuron and Perceptron

As mentioned initially, human neurons and artifical neurons actually have a lot of similarities.
